The BloodHound team has been relatively quiet for a while now. It's been 5 months since the release of the Containers update, and outside of some bugfixes, nothing much has changed.

All that is about to change.

We're proud to announce the release of BloodHound 2.0, representing the second major release of the project with tons of new features, bugfixes, and new abuse primitives.

# Major New Features

## Four New Edges
BloodHound 2.0 is adding four new attack primitives of varying complexity and interest. The new attack primitives should help find new paths when executing engagements.

### CanRDP - Remote Desktop Privileges
The CanRDP edge runs from a user or a group to a computer and indicates that the principals are part of the **Remote Desktop Users** local group on the target system. While this does not immediately guarantee privileged access, if you can find a privilege escalation on the target, this results in another attack vector that isn't often looked at, and difficult to enumerate on a large scale. Collection of this edge belongs to the new RDP collection method.

### ExecuteDCOM - Distributed COM
The ExecuteDCOM edge runs from a user or a group to a computer and indicates that the principals are part of the **Distributed COM Users** local group on the target system. Depending on the security descriptor on the target system, users in this group sometimes have remote code execution privileges without corresponding administrative permissions on the target system. This provides another lateral movement method that does not require administrative access. Collection of this edge belongs to the new DCOM collection method.

### ReadLAPSPassword - LAPS Password Readers
The ReadLAPSPassword edge runs from a user or a group to a computer and indicates that LAPS is likely installed on the target computer and the principal can read the password for the local administrator account from LDAP. In addition to this edge, we've enabled other ACL edges on computer objects that allow the ability to gain access to the LAPS password. Reading the password from Active Directory is effectively the same as having admin to a system, and enables collection and evaluation of more attack paths. Collection of this edge and the new ACL edges falls under the existing ACL collection method.

### AllowedToDelegate - Constrained Delegation
A very complicated attack that has several caveats, constrained delegation presents a complex method of compromising a computer, and possibly more. Will Schroeder [(harmj0y)](https://twitter.com/harmj0y) wrote about this permission a while ago and called it ["The most dangerous user right you (probably) have never heard of."](http://www.harmj0y.net/blog/activedirectory/s4u2pwnage/). At its most dangerous, this edge can enable a principal to DCSync without any of the corresponding rights you would expect to see in Active Directory. Collection of this edge takes place during the ObjectProps collection method.

## File Output and Ingestion Changes - JSON and Zip
One of the biggest changes (and the one that required a version bump) is the complete change of the output format for SharpHound. As of 2.0, output from the collector is JSON, and defaults to compressing to a Zip file and removing the JSON files from disk. Since we're using JSON files, appending to files is no longer possible. Instead, each run provides a timestamped Zip file that represents the collection run you performed. Switching to JSON provides far more control over the output and should hopefully fix problems with CSV files and column mismatches, which many users have reported.

While we added the feature a while ago, apparently it slipped under the radar. The user interface has supported Zip ingestion since the 1.4 release in October of 2017, but not many people were aware of it. With the output format switching to Zip files, we're emphasizing this feature and its ease of use benefit. Additionally, we've added drag and drop support to the user interface. You can just drop your file on top of the UI to ingest it instead of using the upload button.

![Drag N' Drop](/bloodhound20/dragndrop.gif)

Ease of use is always something we consider when implementing new features, and we think this streamlines the workflow of getting data into the user interface and the database.

## Edge Filtering
Sometimes, you want to execute an attack path that doesn't use certain attack types. Maybe you want to just execute a path that uses one of the new edges that may or may not result in admin rights. Before 2.0, this required writing a custom cypher query to filter out edges you weren't interested in. BloodHound 2.0 has a built in way to filter edges from ShortestPath queries that applies to everything in the UI, including pre-built queries.

![Edge Filtering UI](/bloodhound20/edgefilter.png)

Changes you make in this UI element will persist across uses of BloodHound and are saved similar to other settings.

![RDP Rights](/bloodhound20/dfmcanrdp.png)

In the above screenshot, the user dfm has RDP privileges to WINDOWS1. However, if we don't want to use RDP, we can filter out the edge type and see if dfm still has a path:

![Filter RDP](/bloodhound20/edgefilter.gif)

After stripping the RDP edge, we find that dfm still has a path to the computer!

## Edge Addition/Deletion
Sometimes you find a weird path that doesn't really fit in the context of the BloodHound graph. Maybe you know a user has admin on a system using some kind of SQL abuse or a third-party application. In BloodHound 2.0, you can easily add this to the graph using the built-in workflow to add an edge. To access this UI, right click anywhere on the graph where nothing else exists (the stage menu) to open the new context menu.

![Stage Menu](/bloodhound20/stagemenu.png)

Clicking on **Add Edge** will open a new window that allows you to add edges between two nodes of your choice.

![Add Edge](/bloodhound20/addedgemenu.png)

This new feature allows you to easily model attack paths that don't follow traditional paths. Along with this feature, we also added the ability to delete edges straight from the user interface. Letâ€™s say you find a user that is a local administrator to a system, but is disabled and interfering with pathfinding. Now you can easily right click on the edge to delete it.

![Edge Menu](/bloodhound20/deleteedgemenu.png)

If you add or delete an edge, you can click the **Reload Query** button in the stage menu to re-run the current query that's present in the UI.

![Edge Menu](/bloodhound20/reloadquery.gif)

## Node Addition/Deletion/Modification
While this feature has less applications in our opinion, there are certainly times when modifying nodes is useful. The stage menu also allows you to add a node, which opens the **Add Node** UI.

![Add Node](/bloodhound20/addnode.png)

Deleting a node can be done by right clicking on any node and using the context menu.

![Node Menu](/bloodhound20/nodemenu.png)

You can also modify the properties on nodes, which will be saved in the database, from the same menu. This is helpful if you perform a targeted kerberoast attack for example, where you can set the HasSPN property of the user to allow pathfinding from kerberoastable users.

![Edit Node](/bloodhound20/editnode.png)

## Owned/High Value Properties
Tom Porter [(porterhau5)](https://twitter.com/porterhau5) did some fantastic work on forking BloodHound and adding the ability to mark users/computers that have been "owned". We decided that this feature is awesome and integrated it into the main fork with some modifications. User and computer nodes now have the owned property, and are marked on the user interface with a small skull. We've also added the ability to mark nodes as "High Value", which is represented with a diamond on the node.

![Owned/High Value Nodes](/bloodhound20/ownedhighval.png)

When ingestion is done, all user/computer nodes are initially marked as not owned. Certain groups are automatically marked as High Value, including Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, and other groups that lead to high privileges. Along with these new properties, we've introduced new pre-built queries that work with these properties.

![New Pre-Built Queries](/bloodhound20/newprebuilt.png)

You can easily set these properties on nodes from the right click context menu as well, which will save into the database for future use.

![Node Menu](/bloodhound20/nodemenu.png)

## Edge Help
One of our favorite new features is the built in edge abuse help now available in the BloodHound user interface. Right clicking on any edge will present you with the option to click on **Help**.

![Edge Help](/bloodhound20/edgehelp.png)

Each help menu presents you with general information about the edge, as well as detailed information on how to abuse the privileges. Along with these comes OPSEC considerations you should be aware of, as well as references to other resources. Abuse info is tied to the type of the target node, so you'll always have relevant information for the attack you're trying to execute.

![Abuse Info](/bloodhound20/edgeabuseex.png)

## Merged LDAP Queries
In the initial release of SharpHound, one of the features that saved network overhead as well as time was unified LDAP queries. When running Default collection, only one LDAP query was performed instead of four. Eventually, the ability to specify multiple collection methods using a comma separated list was added in BloodHound 1.5 and each collection method ran as a separate query. With 2.0, SharpHound now resolves all selected collection methods and dynamically builds a LDAP filter that encompasses the data and properties from all of them.

![Resolved Collection Methods](/bloodhound20/resolvedcollection.png)

This once again ensures that all collection is performed with a single query, optimizing network usage.

## Persistent LDAP Connection
Ben Campbell [@Meatballs__](https://twitter.com/Meatballs__) pointed out that SharpHound spins up a large number of LDAP connections when doing enumeration, which causes a significant amount of overhead on building Kerberos handshakes. He provided an [alternative solution](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/SharpHound/pull/30) which maintains a persistent LDAP connection. 

As of 2.0, SharpHound will use a cached LDAP connection to request resources which should speed up enumeration time in group enumeration at the very least, and possibly in more areas.

## Notes and Pictures
Sometimes, you want to keep notes for your operation. Maybe you want to note how a user was owned or where you got a credential from. Maybe a file in a share that was particularly useful. With the 2.0 release, we've added a Notes field to every node that persists in the database.

![Notes](/bloodhound20/notes.png)

We've also added the ability to attach pictures to nodes. You can drag and drop an image file into the node information window to attach it. This feature is all managed locally, so the image configuration is on a per-user basis and will not sync between users.

![Attach Pictures](/bloodhound20/attachpic.gif)

The images will have a copy button and a delete button. The copy button will copy the full path to the file on disk to your clipboard.

## Language Independent Pre-Built Queries + Data
When switching to the JSON format, one of the top priorities was ensuring that the objectsid parameter is stored for every node. This allows queries to use the objectsid instead of the name of the object. Domain Admins is now referenced by its objectsid that ends in -512, meaning it will work regardless of the actual name of the object in the database. Additionally, we've switched the encoding of files output by the ingestor to UTF8 in order to properly support foreign language domains.

# Minor Updates
These updates, while not as significant, are still cool additions to the project which some will find useful.

## Dark Mode (Beta)
We've added a dark mode feature to the user interface which should make it significantly easier on the eyes in dark environments. We don't anticipate many people using this because hackers definitely don't sit in dark rooms. This feature likely has some bugs associated with it, so if you find some, let us know!

![Dark Mode](/bloodhound20/darkmode.png)

## New Properties and Lowercase Property Names
New properties have been added to every single node type.

* Users
   * Description
   * AdminCount
   * UserPassword (This property can sometimes have the real password for the user and be in plaintext, readable by any user!)
   * Title
   * HomeDirectory
* Groups
   * Description
   * AdminCount
* Computers
   * ServicePrincipalNames
* GPO
   * GPCFileSysPath
   * Description
* OU
   * Description
* Domains
   * Description

All properties are now stored in all lower case in the database for consistency.

## Random File Names, Encrypted Zip, ZipFileName
A feature request we've had several times is the ability to randomize file names to prevent EDR solutions from signaturing the filenames. We've introduced the **RandomFileNames** parameter with 2.0 which will generate meaningless filenames to throw off signatures.

![Random Filenames](/bloodhound20/random.png)

Additionally, the **EncryptZip** parameter was added which generates a random 10 character password for the Zip file. This Zip file can *not* be uploaded to the interface directly and must be unzipped manually.

![Zip Password](/bloodhound20/zippassword.png)

The **ZipFileName** parameter allows you to manually specify the name of the Zip file thatâ€™s created if you want to change the default.

## LDAPUser + LDAPPass Parameters
Another feature request we've received is to specify a credential for querying LDAP, similar to the Credential parameter in PowerView. We've added this in the form of the **LdapUser** and **LdapPass** parameters, which will create a NetworkCredential for use in LDAP queries.

Note: NetworkCredentials do NOT apply to API calls to remote systems such as NetSessionEnum or queries for Local Groups. These will likely fail if you use this method instead of the more recommended runas /netonly method.

## Hierarchical Default Layout
The default layout was the Force Directed layout for quite a while. We decided that the hierarchical view offers more in most situations, and that many users weren't even aware of the ability to change layouts. We've made hierarchical view the default going forward.

## Removed Node Sibling Collapse
Node Sibling Collapse was one of the features that was added in order to reduce the load required for the user interface to draw graphs. In practice, this logic was almost never applied or useful, and resulted in a huge computation load when processing data. We've completely removed the feature which should speed up pre-display data processing.

## Removed DCSync Edge
We've removed the DCSync edge in favor of the *Find Principals with DCSync Rights* query. In practice, the DCSync edge was inaccurate and only covered a small number of cases. Many of the principals that have DCSync privileges by default are now marked as high value, and other principals can be manually marked as such.

## Added GPOs Affecting this OU
This new query allows you to see the effective GPOs applied to an OU. This can help you isolate what GPO is making a particular change, or figure out what GPOs you can modify for a specific attack vector.

## Renamed LoopTime to LoopDelay
LoopTime was a terrible parameter name. LoopDelay makes far more sense.

## Brought some sanity to the rescaler
![Zip Password](/bloodhound20/camera.gif)

Anyone who has tried to make cool pictures in the UI knows how annoying the camera can be. We've finally brought some sanity to the rescale middleware so you should have a bit more freedom in moving stuff without your mouse pointer rocketing off the screen.

## Final Thoughts
BloodHound 2.0 represents one of the biggest releases to date with many new features and a completely new output format. It should also enable significant analysis opportunities in the UI while lowering the barrier to entry for database modifications. As usual, you can grab compiled versions of the UI and the collector, or self-compile, from our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/releases).

You can always find us in the [BloodHound Slack Channel](https://bloodhoundgang.herokuapp.com/). The link will allow you to get an invite and join our active community with over 1700 users. We look forward to hearing from new and old users alike on their thoughts on 2.0.
